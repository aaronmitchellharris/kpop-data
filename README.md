# Kpop-Numbers

This is a website designed for visualizing data on Kpop (Korean Pop) music videos on Youtube. Music video information 
is initially added manually and the website automatically updates the data daily with Youtube's api. Visualizing this 
data in an easy to read format aids in locating trends or correlations with an artist's popularity and other factors. 
This website is still a work in progress.
